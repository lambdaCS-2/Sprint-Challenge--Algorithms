#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  O(n) Run time is based on input size.


b)  O(n log n) 


c)  O(n) Run time is based on input size.

## Exercise II

Because the building floors can assume to be ordered, the fastest way to search would be a binary search. Drop your first egg from the middle most floor. If the egg breaks when you drop it, go halfway down and try again. If it does not break, go halfway up and try again. Keep dividing in half up or down until f is found. Runtime is O(log n) because it is based on input, but reduces exponentially.
